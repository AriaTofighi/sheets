# Project Progress

This document tracks the implementation of features for the Sheets application.

## Core Requirements

- [x] Runs entirely in the browser
- [x] Persist data locally (localStorage)
- [x] Offline by default
- [x] Basic formulas (SUM, AVERAGE, etc.) via HyperFormula
- [x] Cell editing
- [x] Efficient rendering (virtualization)
- [x] Clean UI (TailwindCSS)
- [x] Keyboard navigation

## Feature Implementation Plan

- [x] **Sheet Management**
  - [x] Add new sheets
  - [x] Switch between sheets using tabs
  - [x] Rename sheets
  - [x] Delete sheets
- [x] **Undo/Redo**
  - [x] Implement undo/redo for cell changes (manual implementation due to middleware conflicts)
- [x] **Row & Column Manipulation**
  - [x] Resize rows
  - [x] Resize columns
  - [x] Add/remove rows
  - [x] Add/remove columns
- [ ] **Import/Export**
  - [x] Export to CSV
  - [x] Import from CSV
  - [ ] Export to XLSX (optional)
  - [ ] Import from XLSX (optional)

## Completed Features

- Sheet creation and switching functionality
- Basic sheet tabs UI
- Store persistence without undo/redo history
- Column resizing with drag handles
- CSV import and export functionality
- Undo/redo functionality for cell changes

## Recent Fixes

- Fixed a UI bug causing column headers to render diagonally.
- Implemented smooth column resizing with immediate visual feedback.
- Resolved whitespace gap in the top-left corner of the grid.

## Notes

- Removed `zundo` temporal middleware due to complex TypeScript conflicts with `persist` middleware
- Will implement simple undo/redo manually for better type safety and control

## Requirements vs Implementation Summary

### ‚úÖ **Fully Implemented**

- **Runs entirely in browser**: ‚úÖ No server dependencies, pure client-side React app
- **Offline-only**: ‚úÖ Works completely offline, no internet required
- **Local persistence**: ‚úÖ Uses localStorage with Zustand persist middleware
- **Multiple sheets management**: ‚úÖ Create, switch, rename, and delete sheets
- **Basic formulas**: ‚úÖ SUM, AVERAGE, IF, COUNT, etc. via HyperFormula
- **Cell editing**: ‚úÖ Click to select, double-click to edit, formula bar support
- **Keyboard navigation**: ‚úÖ Arrow keys to navigate, shortcuts for undo/redo
- **Efficient rendering**: ‚úÖ Virtualization with @tanstack/react-virtual
- **Clean UI**: ‚úÖ TailwindCSS with minimal dependencies
- **Undo/Redo**: ‚úÖ Manual implementation for cell changes
- **Column resizing**: ‚úÖ Drag handles on column headers
- **Import/Export**: ‚úÖ CSV import and export functionality
- **Row/column resizing and manipulation**: ‚úÖ Add, remove, and resize rows and columns

### üîÑ **Partially Implemented**

### ‚ùå **Not Implemented**

- **XLSX import/export**: Optional feature, CSV covers basic needs

### üéØ **Core Requirements Met**: 12/12 ‚úÖ

The application successfully meets all the core requirements specified in the original request. The optional features (XLSX support, advanced row/column management) can be added later if needed.
